# Playing with Golang -- Downloading Flags

I decided I wanted to learn a little bit of golang, just for kicks. Looks like a kind of cool language. I tried writing this really small program that would just pull down a ton of these little flag gifs. 

#### To run:
```sh
go run pullingFlags.go getterSkeleton.go runTypes.go
```
