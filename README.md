# Playing with Golang -- Downloading Flags

I decided I wanted to learn a little bit of golang, just for kicks. Looks like a kind of cool language. I tried writing this really small program that would just pull down a ton of these little flag gifs. 

#### To run:
```sh
go run pullingFlags.go getterSkeleton.go runTypes.go
```

##### Todo:
- for some reason when doing this with the goroutines, it stalls towards the end. Cannot figure out why. Worked for awhile.
- Figure out returning values from a goroutine and if thats kosher.
